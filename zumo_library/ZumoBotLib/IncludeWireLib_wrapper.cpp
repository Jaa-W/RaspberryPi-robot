  *   --- THIS FILE GENERATED BY S-FUNCTION BUILDER: 3.0 ---
  *
  *   This file is a wrapper S-function produced by the S-Function
  *   Builder which only recognizes certain fields.  Changes made
  *   outside these fields will be lost the next time the block is
  *   used to load, edit, and resave this file. This file will be overwritten
  *   by the S-function Builder block. If you want to edit this file by hand, 
  *   you must change it only in the area defined as:  
  *
  *        %%%-SFUNWIZ_wrapper_XXXXX_Changes_BEGIN 
  *            Your Changes go here
  *        %%%-SFUNWIZ_wrapper_XXXXXX_Changes_END
  *
  *   For better compatibility with the Simulink Coder, the
  *   "wrapper" S-function technique is used.  This is discussed
  *   in the Simulink Coder User's Manual in the Chapter titled,
  *   "Wrapper S-functions".
